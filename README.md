# Demo Java MongoDB Spring API

This application was given to us for use with the DevOps section of my Platform Engineer training
with Sparta Global.

The app was deployed on AWS EC2 instances, with Auto Scaling Groups, using AWS VPC's,
using AWS Elastic Beanstalk and for use with AWS S3 Buckets.

Upon Completion of my training the app stopped working. I created a new database and connected the app to the new db. I also removed the applications security features as this is a test app.

The App now works again as intended and is still serving its purpose as a demo/test application
